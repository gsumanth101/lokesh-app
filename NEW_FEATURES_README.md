# Smart Farming Assistant - New Features Update

## 🎆 Overview

This update introduces two major enhancements to the Smart Farming Assistant interface:

1. **New Tab Management**: Each user type now opens in a dedicated browser tab
2. **Enhanced Security**: Admin-only creation of admin and agent accounts

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. 📑 New Tab Management

**Problem Solved**: Users with multiple roles needed better workflow organization.

**Solution**: 
- Each user type (Admin, Farmer, Buyer, Agent) opens in a dedicated browser tab
- JavaScript manages tab titles and window names for better organization
- Users can work with multiple accounts simultaneously without confusion

**How it Works**:
- Login detection triggers JavaScript that checks current user role
- If role differs from previous session, a new tab opens automatically
- Page titles are dynamically set based on user role:
  - 🛡️ Admin Dashboard - Smart Farming
  - 🌾 Farmer Dashboard - Smart Farming
  - 🛒 Buyer Dashboard - Smart Farming
  - 🤝 Agent Dashboard - Smart Farming

### 2. 🔒 Enhanced Security & Access Control

**Problem Solved**: Unrestricted account creation posed security risks.

**Solution**:
- Only admin users can create new admin or agent accounts
- Regular registration is limited to farmer and buyer roles
- Dedicated admin section for privileged account management

**Implementation**:
- Registration form only shows "Farmer" and "Buyer" options for regular users
- Admin dashboard includes new "Create Account" tab for admin/agent creation
- Role validation prevents unauthorized account creation

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Regular Users

1. **Registration**: 
   - Go to sidebar → Register
   - Choose between "Farmer" or "Buyer" roles only
   - Complete registration normally

2. **Login Experience**:
   - Login with your credentials
   - Notice the browser tab title changes to match your role
   - If you switch between different user types, new tabs may open

### For Administrators

1. **Creating Admin/Agent Accounts**:
   - Login with admin credentials (`admin@smartfarm.com` / `admin123`)
   - Navigate to "Create Account" tab in admin dashboard
   - Create new admin or agent accounts with full privileges

2. **User Management**:
   - View all users in the "Users" tab
   - Monitor system statistics and user activity
   - Manage crop listings and offers across the platform

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Tab Management

```javascript
// JavaScript embedded in Streamlit app
document.title = "{page_title}";

var currentRole = "{user_role}";
var storedRole = sessionStorage.getItem('userRole');

if (storedRole !== currentRole) {
    sessionStorage.setItem('userRole', currentRole);
    
    // Open new tab for different user types
    if (storedRole !== null) {
        var newWindow = window.open(window.location.href, currentRole + '_dashboard');
        if (newWindow) {
            newWindow.focus();
        }
    }
}
```

### Access Control

```python
# Python validation in registration
current_user = st.session_state.get('current_user', {})
if user_role in ['admin', 'agent'] and current_user.get('role') != 'admin':
    st.sidebar.error("Only admin can create new admin or agent accounts.")
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### app.py
- **login_user()**: Enhanced with JavaScript for tab management
- **logout_user()**: Added session storage cleanup
- **Registration section**: Restricted role selection for regular users
- **Admin dashboard**: Added "Create Account" tab for privileged account creation

### New Files Added
- **demo_new_features.py**: Demonstration script for new features
- **NEW_FEATURES_README.md**: This documentation file

## 🎯 Default Accounts

The system comes with pre-configured accounts for testing:

| Role | Email | Password | Description |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Admin | admin@smartfarm.com | admin123 | Full system access |
| Agent | agent@smartfarm.com | agent123 | Farmer assistance |

## 🔍 Testing the Features

### Test New Tab Management

1. Login as admin (watch tab title change)
2. Logout and login as a different user type
3. Notice new tab behavior and organization

### Test Access Control

1. **As Regular User**:
   - Try to register → Only see farmer/buyer options
   - Cannot create admin/agent accounts

2. **As Admin**:
   - Access admin dashboard
   - Use "Create Account" tab to create admin/agent accounts
   - View all users and system statistics

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- JavaScript features work best in modern browsers
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are fully supported
- Some popup blockers may prevent new tab opening

### Session Management
- Browser session storage tracks user roles
- Logging out clears session data
- Multiple tabs can run different user types simultaneously

### Security Considerations
- Admin accounts should be carefully managed
- Agent accounts have elevated privileges
- Regular users are restricted to farmer/buyer roles

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### New Tab Not Opening
- Check browser popup blocker settings
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try different browsers

### Cannot Create Admin/Agent Account
- Verify you're logged in as admin
- Check admin dashboard "Create Account" tab
- Regular registration won't show these options

### Role Restrictions
- Only admins can create admin/agent accounts
- This is by design for security
- Contact system administrator for privileged accounts

## 🎊 Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Each user type has dedicated workspace
2. **Enhanced Security**: Controlled account creation prevents unauthorized access
3. **Improved Workflow**: Multiple roles can work simultaneously
4. **Clear Separation**: Visual distinction between different user types
5. **Administrative Control**: Centralized user management for admins

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Role-based theme customization
- Advanced tab management features
- Audit logging for account creation
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Real-time notifications across tabs
